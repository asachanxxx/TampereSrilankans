UI-ONLY Auth (Login + Register + Google + Facebook) — One Page Spec
Goal

Build one responsive Auth page: /auth
It contains:

Social login buttons: Google + Facebook

Tabs: Login | Register

Forms (UI-only, no Supabase yet)

On submit: call mock auth functions and redirect accordingly.

Tech

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + lucide-react

Use shadcn components:

Card, Tabs, Button, Input, Label, Separator, Alert, Toast

Route

Create: src/app/auth/page.tsx

Layout & UX
Structure (centered card)

Full page background: soft neutral

Center Card (max-w-md)

Top:

App logo + “Welcome back”

Small subtitle: “Sign in to manage your events”

Social buttons row:

Continue with Google

Continue with Facebook

Divider:

Separator with text “or”

Tabs:

Login | Register

Login tab fields

Email

Password

Button: Sign in

Small link (UI-only): “Forgot password?”

Register tab fields

Display name

Email

Password

Confirm password

Checkbox: “I agree to Terms” (optional UI)

Button: Create account

Validation (client-side only)

Email format

Password min length (e.g., 8)

Confirm password matches

Show errors in Alert under the form

Disable submit while “loading” (fake 600ms delay)

Mobile rules

Card is full width with padding

Buttons stack vertically on small screens

Mock auth state (UI-only)

Create: src/state/session.tsx

currentUser: AppUser | null

loginMock({ email }) sets role user

loginAdminMock() sets role admin (for testing only)

registerMock({ displayName, email }) sets role user

logout()

Also create src/models/user.ts (already in your spec):

Include displayName.

Button behaviors (UI-only)
Google/Facebook buttons

Do NOT integrate OAuth now.

On click:

Show toast: “Google sign-in (UI only)”

Call loginMock() and redirect to /me

Login submit

On submit success → redirect to /me

Add hidden dev shortcut:

A small link: “Login as Admin (demo)” → calls loginAdminMock() and redirects /admin

Register submit

On submit success → redirect to /me

Components to create (clean reusable)

Create:

src/components/auth/AuthCard.tsx (wraps card layout)

src/components/auth/SocialButtons.tsx

src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx

src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx

All components must be typed, clean, and responsive.

Visual polish requirements

Use consistent spacing: space-y-4/6

Buttons: full width

Inputs: consistent height

Subtle icons:

Google icon, Facebook icon (use lucide placeholders if needed)

Soft shadows, rounded-2xl card

No bright colors, use muted accent

Definition of Done

/auth looks modern and responsive

Tabs switch smoothly

Validation errors show clearly

Social buttons + forms work with mock session

Successful auth redirects:

user → /me

admin demo → /admin
